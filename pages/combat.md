# Round

### Surprise
With surprise you can perform one round of actions unanswered and you have +1 chance to hit.

### Priority
At the start of each round, roll 1d6 to determine the priority. 1-3 PCs, 4-6 opponents (context might change the odds). The phases are resolved simultaneously for each group, by priority within each phase.  
Side A Opening then side B Opening, side A Melee then side B Melee, etc.  
Members of the same side can act in any order they wish between themselves. Actions are resolved as they are declared.  
A fataly wounded fighter can still finish their action or attacks in the same phase (simultaneous action, if you kill a fighter, they may still kill you in the same phase).  

### Phases
Each phase lists the possible actions within it. 
* 0  Priority roll
* 1  Opening Phase
    - Ranged attacks
    - Movement
    - Cast quick spells 
* 2  Melee Phase
    - Melee attacks
* 3  Ritual Phase
    - Cast slow spells
* 4  End of round
    - Any check for Morale or Saves
    - Note the remaining duration of effects

## Actions
You have two actions per round, but can act only once per phase.

You cannot trade a phase-specific action for an action specific to another phase, e.g. Melee for another Movement.

However, you can do a miscellaneous action instead of an Opening or Melee action.
#### Miscellaneous actions
* Ready a worn item, take something, use a readied item (e.g. potion)
* Protect an adjacent ally: any attacks they suffer this round are redirected to you
* First aid
* Test your Presence to prevent allies from making a Morale check this round
* Other similar actions.
#### Forgo all other actions to:
* Reload a crossbow
* Retreat from melee
* Search and ready a packed item

### Spells
To cast spells, you must be out of melee.  
You must declare a spell in the Opening phase. Make a Capture Save: on a success you cast the spell now. On failure you cast it in ritual phase. If you are hit in-between, you lose your action and the spell fails (but is not lost, you can try to cast it again later).

### Movement
The side without priority declares its movement, and the side with priority can interrupt or hinder with its own movement.
#### Space
1 space = 2 meters in the game world. For theater of the mind, that’s all you need.   
With a battlemap and ruler, 1 space = 2cm.   
If you aren’t used to metric, you may use:  
1 space = 5 feet in the game world.  
With a map and ruler, 1 space = 1’’.  
#### Speed
Your speed is equal to your Capture save. It is the number of spaces you can cover in one round with a move action.  
You swim and climb at half speed. Rough terrain also halve your speed. If your are Slow, halve your base speed. Minimum speed is 1.  
#### Moving
You can move up to your speed. You may pass through allies if there is enough space, but not enemies.  
If you start the Opening phase outside of melee range, you may move up to twice your speed.  You may try to evade the combat (see Encounters, Chase).   
If you are in melee range, you can only move closer to the enemy unless you disengage and retreat.  
To disengage and retreat from melee, you have to forgo all other actions this round and can move up to your speed away from the melee.   

### Melee attacks

1. You must allocate your attacks as equally as possible between targets within reach. Then proceed in order for each target:
2. Deduct the target’s Armor value from your Combat stat to obtain the chance to hit per attack die.
3. Roll 1d12 per attack and count successes. A result of 12 is always an automatic failure.
4. Each successful attack inflicts 1 damage.  

The Referee rolls attacks for the enemies, PCs for themselves and their allies.  

Attacks are simultaneous unless one side has:
* Charged this round
* Surprise
* Attack on the flank

In this case, the side with advantage has First Strike. Your attacks are resolved first in the melee phase, and enemies you kill are eliminated immediately, before the end of the phase (they lose their action and can’t strike back).

* You can forgo all your attacks in the melee phase to gain +1 armor.
* You can forgo your attacks to attempt a grappling or other maneuver. Bash, push, etc

|   | None | Shield | Light | Light+ | Medium | Medium+ | Heavy | Heavy+ |
|---|------|--------|-------|--------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
|Melee | 8 | 7 | 7 | 6 | 6 | 5 | 5 | 4 |
|Ranged | 7 | 5 | 6 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1 |

_Melee: 8-armor_  
_Ranged: 7/6/4/3, shield substracts 2_  
Failing a ranged attack with a 10+ result hits an ally engaged in melee with the target instead.

#### Modifiers
* Surprise: first strike, +1 chance to hit
* Flanking: first strike, +1 chance to hit
* Death Blow: you can attack a prone enemy only if there is no standing enemy within reach. Your attacks hit automatically.
* Prone: you are vulnerable to death blows. You can attack from the ground, but only up to 1 ATK and you have -1 chance to hit. You cannot get back up the same round you got prone.
* Improvised weapon: -1 chance to hit.
* Disarmed: -1 chance to hit. Others have +1 ATK against you.
* Advantage (e.g. high ground): +1 chance to hit.

### Typical Modifiers
#### Advantage
+2 Combat, e.g. high ground, target prone, target attacked from behind, etc.
#### Mounted
NPCs get +1 Might (+1 HP, +1 attack). PCs get +1 attack and can choose to sacrifice the mount to absorb 1 damage for them.
#### Improvised weapon
Target armor is deducted twice from your Combat stat. 
#### Unarmed
As improvised weapon, and enemies have +2 Combat against you.
#### Narrow surroundings
Fighting in the doorway, for example, could reduce the number of attacks that fighters can make, as well as the number of fighters who can attack.
#### Blinded
Unable to attack.
#### Prone
Enemies have +2 Combat against you. Getting up costs half your speed. Adjacent opponents may try to prevent you from getting up if they have priority. You cannot get back up in the same round in which you were knocked down.

### Ranged attacks
You can’t make ranged attacks once you are in melee range.  
Your ammo must be Readied.  
Resolve as for Melee, but if you have multiple attacks, you must allocate all your attacks to the same target.  
#### Target with shield  
Unless you use a javelin or crossbow, or shoot them from a good angle, you deduct twice the Armor of your target from your Combat stat.  
#### Target engaged in melee  
The closest ally is hit instead if you get a 10+, they take 1 damage.   
* Ranged attacks against incoming charge: 3-in-6 chance for the side to shoot before contact, otherwise the charge connects before the volley.  
* You cannot chain ranged and melee attacks unless you have a throwing weapon in one hand and a melee weapon in the other.  
* If you have a light throwing weapon, you can throw it while charging (francisque, javelin).   

### Criticals
Crits apply both to PCs and NPCs. Critical hits do not affect creatures with Supernatural HP.
A result of 1 on an attack die is a Critical. It deals 1 damage as normal but add also 1 Wound in the inventory.
Roll 1d10+10 on the Mutilation table: the Wound is a temporary version of the result. The targeted area is incapacitated until the wound is treated and the wounded rests for a full day. 
You can sacrifice your helmet to cancel a Critical.
Push
Once per series of attacks, you can choose to reroll one failed die. If the new result is a success, you deplete your weapon. If the new result is a failure, you deplete twice your weapon. If the weapon should break, it does after the attacks are resolved.

### Grappling
You can attempt a gambit instead of any other action, but only once per round.  
This is how you resolve combat maneuvers such as disarming, tripping, pushing, grappling, subduing an enemy, etc.  
You describe the effect you wish to achieve, and the Referee gives you the odds of success on 1d6, taking into account the difference in size, level, capability and circumstances. Typically 2-in-6 if inferior, 3-in-6 if equal and 4-in-6 if superior.   
The risks involved in case of failure are proportional to the desired effect unless you can secure an advantage before.  
Several characters can join forces for a single gambit. Enemies can also attempt gambits.  

### Vanquish
An NPC who reaches 0 HP is slain at the end of the current phase. They can still act in this phase (simultaneous action).   
Hits are opportunistic and aim for the highest lethality. If you want to shoot them in the eye, it’s just a normal attack and unless you reduce them to 0 HP, you don’t achieve this outcome.  
Vulnerable target  
If you manage to get close enough a target while they are unaware, and you can ensure a killing blow (mitigate armor, size, etc), the victim is slain instantly. Otherwise, you automatically deal 1 damage for each of your attacks (special resistances still apply).  

An NPC at exactly 0 HP has 2-in-6 chance to survive, mutilated.

### Formal Duel
As with rock-paper-scissors, duelists must simultaneously declare their technique for the round between Parry, Assault and Feint. The winner gets a bonus for the round.
* Parry beats Assault : +2 armor
* Assault beats Feint : +1 Attack
* Feint beats Parry : +2 chance to hit
* Same: both get the bonus as if they had won.

Exceptionally, during a duel, NPCs can sunder their shield as a PC would.

### Morale
PCs never test Morale, but most NPCs do, allies and enemies. Unless they are exceptionally disciplined, insensitive or fanatical, they must check morale when facing a trigger.  
Common morale triggers include:
* Loss of one-third numerical strength
* Death, retreat or surrender of a leader
* Being ambushed
* Horrific situation or enemy
* Retreating or surrendering allies

#### Morale check
Roll 1d12 by group. A result equal to or less than your chances is a success. The chances of success depend on the combatants’ military experience. 
* Weak: 5. Untrained troops.
* Average: 7. Trained troops.
* Strong: 9. Veteran and elite troops. 

Circumstances may modify the chances of success by up to +/- 2.  
A failure results in organized retreat. If they cannot retreat, they will try to surrender. If surrender is not an option either (enemies are not taking prisoners), they will fight to the death.  
Rolling a 12 results in disorganized retreat or surrender.  
On a success, morale holds.  

### End of Combat
A fight lasts at least 10 minutes (1 exploration turn), the time it takes to fight, regroup, breathe, patch wounds, etc.

# Health
## Hit Points (HP)
A damage is something that could kill someone. Each damage removes 1 HP. If you have more than 1 HP, you can survive things that would kill a lesser being. Damage is mostly cosmetic for a character until they lose all their HP, at which point their life is in danger.
#### Save against death
If a character’s HP is reduced to 0, they must make a save against death: if they fail, they die, otherwise they survive by risking a permanent wound (see Wounds).

If alive, the character can continue to act normally thanks to adrenaline, but they are in critical condition.

#### Critical condition
The character is bleeding out and dies at the end of 2 rounds following the one in which they entered the critical condition, unless stabilised. If they suffer further damage while at 0 HP, they die.
* **First aid**: Finesse test (Very hard if you try on yourself). Success: patient stabilised. Failure: a turn spent for nothing. Multiple attempts possible, but only 1 per round.
* **Stabilized**: The character is no longer dying, but still at 0 HP. If they suffer further damage while at 0 HP, they die.
* **Death**: When your character dies, create a new one or take control of a hireling. They quickly join the party.
* **Nemesis**: A creature that kills a PC immediately gains +1 Might (+1 HP, +1 attack).

## Wounds
Wounds caused by critical hits are temporary and last until a week of full rest. 

If you must roll a Wound caused by saving against Death at 0 HP: roll 1d20. On 1-10, it's a temporary wound. On 11-20, it's a permanent wound (substract 10 to know which one on the Wound table). 

Whatever the wound type, it fills one inventory slot until a week of full rest.

If you would get twice the same wound, instead you lose some non-essential bits of yourself (an ear, a finger, a toe, the tip of the nose, teeth, bit of lips, big scar on the face or the skull where hair won't regrow, etc).

If an enemy should suffer a Wound not suitable for an NPC (e.g. -1 to tests of characteristic): characters have +1 chance to hit an enemy for each such Wound they have. 

For each permanent wound you have, you can attract an additional retainer. 

| 1d10 | Wound |
|-----|-------|
| 1 | Shoulder: -1 to bashing chance|
| 2| Arm: -2 to grapple results|
|3| Knee: -2 movement spaces (also apply as penalty in Capture for chases)|
|4| Leg: -1 chance to succeed tests of Agility|
|5| Guts: -1 chance to succeed tests of Vigor|
|6| Head: -1 chance to succeed tests of Finesse|
|7| Back: fills one inventory slot (in addition to the one of the Wound itself until healed) |
|8| Chest: -1 to Saves|
|9| Eye: -1 chance to hit with ranged attacks|
|10| Hand: you cannot use this hand for anything|

### Recovery
1 HP per full day of rest
All HP after a week of downtime (if not restricted by a Wound)
1 Wound per week of downtime


# Battles

You are in melee at 1 space.
* Move figures closer at the beginning of melee, so that their bases touch

### Units
* A Figure is an individual fighter. Figures mainly move together as Ranks in Units.    Player Characters, leaders and creatures differing strongly from their rank are Unique figures.  
* A Rank can include up to 5 figures. Rank describes the position of a given figure in a Unit: front, middle or rear. When a rank has disparate gear, use the one most represented in that rank if equal, or the most inferior if unequal.   
* A Unit is made of figures close enough to be cohesive. A Unit can be made of up to 3 stacked Ranks.   

If you want a rank to be larger than 5,  instead start an adjacent rank as a new Unit parallel to the fisrt.  
One light source is typically enough for 1 rank (it doesn’t allow close inspection).  

### Battle Lines
A Battle Line is formed when two Units meet and the front Ranks clash in melee.
#### Reach
As long as there is at least 1 figure in a rank, you can’t directly attack the rank behind it.

Spear-equipped fighters can attack the enemy’s front from the middle rank of their own unit, but cannot attack the enemy’s middle from the front (since the enemy’s front blocks).

A figure typically have within reach the 3 closest frontal opponents. If you must allocate an inequal number of attacks to figures in a rank, those in the middle suffer more attacks (select randomly if necessary).

#### Attack resolution
When allocating attacks, there are only two types of agents: Unique figures, and the ranks of normal figures.

Refer to Reach to know how to allocate attacks. Regarding attack allocation and resolution, normal figures of one rank are treated as a single entity.

For each agent, resolve the attacks targeting Unique figures first. Then resolve attacks targeting normal figures. 

Damage from attacks targeting normal figures is not allocated target by target, but directly to the rank as a whole. Each time the rank suffer as much damage as the HP of one of its figures, remove one figure from it and consolidate the rank toward the middle.

If a rank is destroyed with excess damage, the excess is dealt to the rank behind it.

#### Resolution order, melee phase
* First strike attacks, remove the dead
* Priority side attacks then other side attacks
* Remove the dead

#### Tides of battle
At the end of a round, for each Battle Line with groups of equal strength, the group that has inflicted the most hits pushes the other back one space and advances one space. Otherwise, the larger group or creatures pushes the other. 

### Casualties
If you want less extreme casualties, each removed figure has 3-in-6 chance to be wounded but alive (they were left for dead in the heat of battle).

### Morale
Per Unit. A routed Unit may attempt a morale check to re-enter combat, only if one round has passed without suffering losses or morale trigger.

### Range in spaces
Melee range : 1  
Dagger throw: 2  
Spear throw: 5  
Handaxe throw: 6  
Javelin throw: 7  
Shortbow: 12  
Crossbow: 24  
Sling: 30  
Longbow: 36  

#### Volley
If you reach a critical mass proportional to the target, double the effective range of ranged weapons.

### Movement
Movement mostly takes place at the Unit scale, but you may scale down to Ranks or figures according to circumstances. 

Cycling between ranks: swapping places with a figure from another rank takes 1 movement action for each (coordination).

If you move over an obstacle or difficult terrain, you may have to test Agility.

#### Retreat
If a creature in melee retreats due to a Morale test, it must pass a Save against Capture or take 1 damage.

### Tactical
#### Leaders
If an Unit has one individual with a greater Might than all other individuals in this Unit, they are the leader of this Unit. A leader increases the morale of the Unit by 1.
#### Duels between leaders
Leaders in the front rank can challenge each other to a duel (resolved with the duel rules), played instead of the clash of the rest of their Unit (each side is watchful of the other to prevent intervention or interrumption of the duel). Refusing a duel results in a morale check for your unit. The death of a leader is also a morale trigger and the check must be made with -2 chances of success after a duel death.
#### War banner
If you have at least a full unit (15 figures), one figure may carry a war banner. Doing so allow the unit to automatically succeed it’s first morale check and increase morale by 1. Losing the war banner triggers a morale check.
#### Cavalry charge
Foot soldiers under cavalry charge must test Morale or break formation, in which case cavalry fighters get +1 attack this round.

An Unit of foot soldiers who succeed with a result of 3 or less can defend with braced spears, in wich case they gain +1 attack against the charge.
#### Cover
Fortifications and other defensive advantages may offer +1 Armor or even more. 
#### Maneuver
Check morale to execute a maneuver. Complex movement of Units count as maneuvers.
* Shieldwall (maneuver): unit moves at half-speed, but is immune to most missiles.
