# Exploration 1

Time
An exploration turn lasts around 10 minutes. Most actions take 1 turn, for example:
Searching a room or a few corpses
Crossing a room or long hallway for the first time
Passing through a room/hallway that has already been explored takes 3x less time than usual (1 turn for 3 rooms/hallways).

### MOVEMENT
Cautious
It is assumed that the characters:
Look all around them (floor, ceiling, walls)
Are watchful of the presence of traps
Are alert to noises, smells and other sensory markers
Do not touch anything that seems abnormal
Are as sneaky as possible
This is the default exploration mode, unless the players explicitly state otherwise. The Referee describes any anomalies, peculiarities or obvious dangers. Once a feature has been described, the way the players interact with it may or may not put them in danger. 
Fast
The group moves three times faster (one turn being equal to 3 unexplored rooms of progress, or 9 explored ones), but makes noise and is unable to spot hidden dangers and small clues. It has no chance to surprise.
Slow
If the characters are burdened. As Cautious, but actions that normally take 1 turn now take two.

#### Speed
* Cautious, inexplored area: 1 turn = 1 room
* Cautious, explored area: 1 turn = 3 rooms
* Quick, inexplored area: 1 turn = 3 rooms
* Quick, explored area: 1 turn = 10 rooms

### Light
A single source of light is sufficient to see the coarse features of a typical small room, but the details require closer inspection. Each inspection requires a separate light source to be carried out in parallel.
When players extinguish a source of light, it depletes it.
* A torch lasts 3 turns and light well. It does not goes out easily, even in movement or if it is dropped.
* A lantern with a candle lasts 6 turns and light dimly. It goes out easily, especially with quick movement or if it is dropped (4-in-6 chance).

### Doors & locks
Listening at doors
2-in-6 chance (Referee roll) of hearing subtle noises behind the door if present. The undead make no noise. If you spend one turn listening, success is guaranteed.
Wooden doors
Weak doors for privacy and thermal insulation can be kicked in quick and easy, with a chance to surprise those inside.
A typical exterior or defensive door is made out of two or more layers of oak planks, held together by iron studs pointed on the front to damage attacker’s weapons trying to break through, and the structure strengthened and stiffened with iron bands. It can be forced, but this depletes the weapon used (not a tool) and makes noise. With a successful Vigor test you can do this quickly with a chance to surprise those inside, otherwise it takes 1 exploration turn. 
Metal or stone doors
Metal or stone doors cannot be forced except by special means.
Lockpicking
Locked doors can be opened with the appropriate key or picked with a lockpick and a successful Finesse test. A lock-picking attempt takes 1 exploration turn. In addition to the time lost, a failure depletes your lockpick.  Silently picking a lock gives you the advantage of surprise over any creatures in the room.

### Searching
Searching a room takes 1 turn of exploration (more for large rooms). This allows characters to find things that are hidden but easily accessible (a key in a drawer), and gives them 2-in-6 chance per turn of searching to get a clue to a secret (such as a loose stone in the wall hiding a secret door).

The group will need to spend 1d6 turns searching to find the trap/secret door, minus 1 per character searching.
D10, autant de chances par tour que de personnes en train de chercher. Un 10 est toujours un échec. Les persos en train de chercher ne font rien d'autre et sont vulnérables. 

### Ignite...
Vegetable oil (oil lamp)
It has a high ignition point, very hard.
Spiders’ webs
Melt quickly and without flame. Do not spread well, only a hole.
Alcohol
Common alcohol is below 40% ABV and cannot be turned into Molotov Cocktails. 
Rare expert alchemists may know how to create high-proof alcohol for medicinal purposes, this would make it highly flammable.
Guano
Highly flammable unless very damp, potentially explosive in large quantities, especially if not recent. 
Fur (living beast)
Easy, but self-extinguish quickly.
The Grind (Referee)
This sub-section is written for the Referee.
Use a classic French-suited 54-cards deck and remove the jokers. 
Each exploration turn, draw a card. If it is a face or ace, something happens:
Face or Ace
♣ ♠	Encounter
♦ ♥	Omen or dungeon event

Each face and ace card should have a specific entry in the dungeon tables.
Any other card means etiher nothing happens or you can key specific events to them.
Light
Every 3 cards, the group depletes all active lights.
Noise
If the group is making noise or attracting attention in any way, draw an extra card each time (to see if they attract an encounter), but put it aside, it doesn’t count towards elapsed time and light consumption.
Omen or Dungeon Event
Encounter omens (tracks, hairs, distant noises) or progress of a dungeon-specific threat (flooding...).
Ongoing effects
Draw as many cards, face-down, as the effect lasts in turns. Make a separate pile from which to draw instead of the main deck. When the face-down pile is depleted, you know the effect is over. This is particularly useful for taking into account the duration of spells.
Shuffle
Shuffle all cards when the group transition from wilderness to dungeon or vice versa, and at the end of each session. 

## Hazards

### Water
* Drowning: character must save against Capture every minute, and drown in case of failure.
* Fall: under 20 meters OK. Up to 30 meters, lose 1 HP. Beyond, save against Death. The depth of the water must be at least equal to half the height of the fall to not crush yourself at the bottom. 

## Rulings

Perception
The group always notices things of importance unless they are in a hurry. There may be layers of information (obvious > hidden > secret), but there’s always information.
Listening at doors
A character will hear open conversations and loud noises. 2-in-6 chance of hearing something if the creatures on the other side are trying to be quiet. If you spend one turn listening, success is guaranteed.
Searching
Searching a room takes 1 turn of exploration (more for large rooms). This allows the group to find things that are hidden but easily accessible (a key in a drawer), and gives 2-in-6 chance per turn of searching to get a clue to a secret (such as a loose stone in the wall hiding a secret door).
Discerning lies
Talking to someone at length allows you to determine whether they are telling the whole truth, but never to know exactly what they are omitting or what is a complete lie.
Outside of the caracter’s voice, the Referee should never declare an NPC lie as truth.
There should be clues about unreliable characters.
Detecting traps
As long as the group advances cautiously, traps are always indicated by clues. It’s up to the players to decide how to proceed.
A trap is triggered when its conditions are met. Its targets get a save against Capture as a last chance to avoid the trap.
Identifying magic items
Licking an object will tell you whether or not it is magical. The taste may provide clues as to the nature of the magic.

Stealth
Global stealth is abstracted by the chance to surprise (see Encounters). If you gain Surprise or you are already aware of creatures who are not aware of you...
Moving silently
As long as the following conditions are met, you can move around undetected without a test.
They are unaware of your presence (you are undetected and there is no alert).
You are not overloaded or wearing heavy armor (light and medium are OK).
You stay in stealth areas (tall grass, behind objects, passages where you can’t be seen easily, etc.).
Make an Agility test to move stealthily in an exposed area, but only if it would be possible to pass undetected (you can’t walk in front of guards without being seen). Also test to stay stealthy while risking noise (walking on dry leaves, jumping down, killing someone, etc). If you have to both cross an exposed area and risk noise, the test is Very Hard.
In the event of an alert, you can’t move in the open or risk noise without being automatically spotted (either seen or heard), and you have to make an Agility test to move unseen even in stealth areas.
If you don’t move, you can hide.
Hiding
If you’re well hidden, a creature must actively Search you to find you (see Perception). 
Stealth deathblow
An unaware target can be killed or wounded easily (see Combat, Vanquish). 
Attacking an alert target while you are unseen  is a normal attack with Surprise rather than a deathblow.
Climbing
You cant’ climb overloaded. 
Without plenty of easy handholds or a rope attached to the top, climbing is hard. A success allow you to climb one story. A failure counts as no progress for a turn. Two failures in a row result in a fall halfway to the height that you would have reached on a  success.
1 Turn...
Placing an anchor point with pitons
Studying a route per 10 meters to find out which routes are passable and what the potential dangers are. One climber can rig a route so no-one else has to study it. 
Climbing 1 story or abseiling 3.
Jumping
Average distances an adventurer can jump. Reduce by half if standing or carrying more than 4 loads (if both, halve then halve again). Test Agility to reach up to double the distance.
Running long jump: 4 meters.
Running vertical jump: 60 cm.
Falling
2 meters or less: no damage.
3 to 6 meters: you lose 1 HP.
7 to 12 meters: you are reduced to 0 HP (save against death).
13+ meters: death.
Falling while secured by a rope and anchor point: height is based on lenght of the rope from the anchor point. The climber still take damage as above due to shock absorption. 1-in-6 chance that the anchor point will give away, 2-in-6 if climbing on ice or a particularly brittle material.

Social
Most social interactions are managed through simple roleplay. Characters try to use relevant levers to influence the people they are interacting with. Reputation, relationship history and trust are important factors. As with other actions, test Presence if necessary.
Oaths
An oath may be taken by one or more persons at a time. They must declare:
In whose name they are taking the oath. 
What they promise to do.
The punishment for breaking the oath.
Chances of success
By default, an oath has a 2-in-6 chance of success:
+1 if you touch a sacred object;
+1 if you perform a sacrifice to seal it (this can be as simple as slashing your hand and spilling your blood to seal your word);
+1 if the proposed punishment is particularly horrible.
The more you increase the odds, the more seriously others will take your oath.
Test
The test is made in secret by the Referee, once per oath and per group.
If unsuccessful, the oath is held only by honour.
If successful, the oath is mixed with magic and breaking it results in the announced punishment, most often in the days that follow via a brutal «coincidence».
The Referee decides whether or not the oath is broken, depending on the considerations of the deity, saint, lord or person (‘I swear the oath, on my mother’) in whose name the oath was made.


# Encounter
This section is written for the Referee.
Surprise
In case of unexpected encounter, roll 1d6 per side, with 2-in-6 chance to be surprised for each side. If one side surprises the other, it becomes aware of it first.
If both are surprised, both spot each other at the same time. Neither side has any advantage.
Surprise can be used to hide, silently evade the threat, start negotiations, overhear, or attack with advantage.
Adjust the chances of surprise for each side according to circumstantial factors. Some creatures have greater chances of surprising the group.
Scouting: any member 1 room or more away from the rest of the party can roll surprise separately from the rest of the group.
Expecting: if one side has already spotted the other, it automatically gains Surprise.
Distance
Dungeon: 1 to 4 rooms away, what makes the most sense
Wilderness: 4d6 x 10 meters
Wilderness, surprise: 1d4 x 10 meters
Numbers
To determine the total combined Might of the monsters encountered:
In the wilderness, roll 2d20. 
In dungeons, roll 1d6 * current dungeon level. 
Divide the total per the Might of the creature to obtain the number appearing. If there is Might left to distribute, it goes to pump the leader. If total Might obtained is not enough for the type of monster encountered, that means the monster is weakened by another battle, sick, or weak for its kind. 
Reaction Roll
Creatures always attack if they have the advantage of surprise. Otherwise if not obvious, roll 1d6 to determine the initial attitude, which is only modified by non-verbal biases such as signs of affiliation by +/- 1.
After the roll, the way players approach the situation can typically switch the result by 1 rank. 
If the conversation stalls, consider the current rank as “last rank” and apply the consequences.
Reaction roll
Score	Creature reaction
1-	Make a Morale check or choose according to power balance. Failure means flight or submission. Success means immediate attack. 
2	Unfavourable. Thin, tense room for negotiation. If last rank, test morale as above.
3-4	Cautious. If last rank, disengages without violence if possible, or gives a final warning if it is the PCs who should leave. If they don’t, test morale as in 1.
5-6	Neutral, open to a fair exchange. If last rank, makes a final take-it-or-leave-it offer. If PCs don’t take it and don’t leave, disengage/warning as above. If the PCs accept a particularly good deal for the creatures, potentially helpful as below. 
7+	Cordial, helpful. Start of a relationship (business, friendship, alliance).

Each creature has its own Disposition which affects the way they approach the situation. Most things are hungry and/or greedy. Combine with the result, e.g. Cautiously hungry.
Actions
Parley
If both sides decide to talk, roleplay the negotiation and use the way players approach the situation to adjust the reaction of NPCs.
Chase
If one side decides to flee, the other may pursue. 
Combat
If one side attacks or maneuvers, start Combat. 

Chase
Compare the speeds of the two parties. Unless splitting apart, a party moves as fast as its slowest member.
Substract the speed of the pursuers from the speed of the evaders. The fleeing party has as much chance in 6 to escape as the remaining speed. The chance to flee is modified by:
+1 for dropping something of interest for pursuers (food, treasure...), if they care
+1 for each obstacle used favoring the evaders (corners, traps, oil, caltrops, off-road trails...)
If you fail, you are caught and the enemy can perform an action against you. You may flee again after if possible.
Dungeon
The chance in 6 to escape is aIso the number of rooms the evaders can pass through before being caught on a failure, or the number of rooms they put between them and pursuers on a success.
Fleeing is done at Fast speed. 
If your pursuer doesn’t know where you are, it will search at reandom for a few rooms. 
Wilderness
A failure indicates evaders are caught within the same day turn, and a success that they put 1 day turn between them and pursuers. Either way, evaders are likely to get lost.
If pursuers can’t track them (4-in-6 they can), it ends the pursuit; if pursuers can track them and are willing to continue, they do but can’t catch the evaders unless the evaders loose their 1 turn of advance.
Ongoing pursuit
Creatures are likely to pursue for as many navigation decisions/turns as the Might of their strongest individual.
