You can prepare as many spells as your Mana, but only one spell per night. Each spell can be cast once, then it needs to be prepared again. If you own twice or more the same spell, each multiple is treated as a separate, individual spell.
* If you wear a witch hat (1 load), you can prepare as many spells as your Mana +1.

There is no limit to the number of spells you can own. To own new spells, you must rely on the Maleficar trait or find them in adventure or through teachers or the skulls of dead mages.
* If you focus near the skull of a freshly dead mage, you have 2-in-6 chance per spell they had to steal the spell before it vanishes in the wild.

Currently everything else for the magic system and spells is based [on this post from Press the Beast](https://pressthebeast.bearblog.dev/nathequest-2026-normal-spell-system-new-new-new/). 

From Pressthebeast:
> Spells are either instantaneous or last for 10 minutes per caster Mana unless otherwise mentioned. They may effect any valid targets the caster can clearly see.
> Some spells require sigils. These can be drawn in 10 minutes, and allow the spell to last indefinitely. Sigils can be carved, drawn with chalk, ink, blood, etc. If erased or destroyed, the spell will falter. Once a sigil is drawn, that spell cannot be recovered unless the sorcerer ends the spell which may be done psychically at any time.

Conversion from the blog post:
* Caster level = caster Mana
* 1d6 damage = 1 damage

Definitions
Magic is secret nature.
The practice of magic consists in extracting patterns of influence (spirits) from this nature in the form of spells.
A spell is a captive spirit, frozen in a function. You don’t learn it, you own it in your head.
Each spell exists as an individual entity and cannot be copied, only moved. You could, however, capture two entities with the same effect (same spell) and thus be able to equip it twice.
Owning spells
There is no limit to the number of spells you can own, but you can only equip as much spells as twice your Mana stat.
A character owns new spells via scrolls discovered on adventures and levels devoted to Mana. Otherwise, a year’s research can lead to the owning of a new random spell.
Recovering a mage’s skull also gives a 2-in-6 chance of recovering the spells they owned (roll for each spell) before they dissipate in the wild.
Mana stat
Your Mana stat is how many dice you can use to cast a spell, allowing you to cast more powerful spells.
Spellcasting stat
Your spellcasting is 9 minus your Armor. It determines the chances of success for each die used in a spell.
Equipped spells
Each spell is 1 load. You can equip as much spells as twice your Mana stat.
You can equip them only when you rest (see Rest and Downtime) and not at any other time.

Casting a spell
To cast a spell, you must:
be out of melee range
have it equipped
not be overloaded
speak high, make incantatory gestures
see the target unless specified otherwise
have one hand free or holding a catalyst
If you cast a spell without the use of a catalyst, you suffer +1 fatigue.
Power & fatigues
To cast a spell, determine how many dice you want to use, up to your Mana stat. A die succeeds if its result is equal or less than your Spellcasting, and fails if higher.
The number of successes is the spell Power.
The number of failures is the Fatigues you take.
If the Power is 0, you fail to cast the spell and it is not exhausted, but you still take fatigues. 
Spell depletion
Once a spell is cast, the spirit is exhausted and the spell disappears from your inventory. You still own it, but you must wait until you rest (see Rest) to equip it again.
Effect and save
A spell succeeds unless it affects a non-voluntary creature or magical object. In this case, the target is always entitled to a save to mitigate or counter the effects of the spell (unless specified otherwise by the spell). The effect of the spell determines the nature of the save.
Sigil
You have one Sigil. You can draw it somewhere to make the effect of some spells permanent (if the spell allows it). If you trace your sigil in another place, it ends the previously maintained spell.
Counterspell
If you have a remaining action in this round and phase, you can try to counter a spell. Treat as casting a spell, if you cast with as much or more Power as the targeted spell, you counter it. You still take Fatigues for failed dice as usual.
Items
Mage’s gear (20 silver each)
Catalyst (1 load): if you cast a spell without it, you suffer 1 fatigue. 
Mana hat (1 load): conceals your mana emanation. If you cast spells without it, you may attract unwanted attention from other magic-users and creatures seeking mana sources. You can also sacrifice your hat to absorb 1 fatigue caused by a spell.
Arcanic Robe (clothing): if you don’t wear armor, increases your save against Witchcraft by 2.
Grimoire (1 load): a grimoire can hold all  your spell scrolls (otherwise 1 scroll = 1 load).
Spell scrolls
Anyone can use a spell scroll.
A spell scroll contains a spell. You can destroy the scroll to cast the spell as if you had +1 die (so if you have 0 Mana, you can cast the spell wiht 1 die). Failing to cast the spell  doesn’t destroy the scroll.
Alternatively, the scroll can be sacrificed to own the spell.
To create a scroll, you need a week of work, one good parchment with special processing (5 silver), and to lose a spell (you don’t own it anymore) as you move it from your skull to the scroll.


Magic limit
If multiple magical effects (spells and/or items) have the same effect, only the most powerful bonus applies.
